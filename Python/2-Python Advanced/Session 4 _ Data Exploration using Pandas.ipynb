It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis/manipulation tool available in any language.\n","pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:\n","\n","* Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet\n","\n","* Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.\n","\n","* Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels\n","\n","* Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure\n","\n","\n","The two primary data structures of pandas, \n","* **Series (1-dimensional)** and \n","* **DataFrame (2-dimensional)**, handle the vast majority of typical use cases in finance, statistics, social science, and many areas of engineering. \n","\n","pandas is built on top of NumPy and is intended to integrate well within a scientific computing environment with many other 3rd party libraries.\n","\n","Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n","\n","* Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\n","\n","* Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects\n","\n","* Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let Series, DataFrame, etc. automatically align the data for you in computations\n","\n","* Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data\n","\n","* Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects\n","\n","* Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets\n","\n","* Intuitive merging and joining data sets\n","\n","* Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets\n","\n","* Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick)\n","\n","* Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases, and saving / loading data from the ultrafast HDF5 format\n","\n","* Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting, and lagging.\n","\n","Many of these principles are here to address the shortcomings frequently experienced using other languages / scientific research environments. For data scientists, working with data is typically divided into multiple stages: munging and cleaning data, analyzing / modeling it, then organizing the results of the analysis into a form suitable for plotting or tabular display. pandas is the ideal tool for all of these tasks.\n","\n","**[Referarnce: pandas Official website: click here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html)**\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"eCe_M7gXusth","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1680320348734,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":16240,"user":{"displayName":"Ubaid Shah","userId":"14042789612785146189"}},"outputId":"ca56649c-61f2-400c-ddf7-9ba53cc6ff86"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://us-python.pkg.dev/colab-wheels/public/simple/\n","Requirement already satisfied: pandas in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (1.4.4)\n","Collecting pandas\n","  Downloading pandas-1.5.3-cp39-cp39-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl (12.2 MB)\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m12.2/12.2 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m77.0 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.8.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from pandas) (2.8.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.20.3 in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from pandas) (1.22.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pytz>=2020.1 in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from pandas) (2022.7.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: six>=1.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages (from python-dateutil>=2.8.1->pandas) (1.16.0)\n","Installing collected packages: pandas\n","  Attempting uninstall: pandas\n","    Found existing installation: pandas 1.4.4\n","    Uninstalling pandas-1.4.4:\n","      Successfully uninstalled pandas-1.4.4\n","Successfully installed pandas-1.5.3\n"]}],"source":["! pip install --upgrade  pandas    # install pandas library"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"ffR7gZyqusti","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1680320369189,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":691,"user":{"displayName":"Ubaid Shah","userId":"14042789612785146189"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd       # import pandas library in notebook"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"id":"zkDh4Gsgustk","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1680320401251,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":553,"user":{"displayName":"Ubaid Shah","userId":"14042789612785146189"}},"outputId":"03e6dc56-4535-472f-c354-125a099ceace"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'1.5.3'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":3}],"source":["pd.__version__            # check the version of the pandas"]},{"cell_type":"raw","metadata":{"id":"LhwoOMtWustf"},"source":["# Series\n","A series in Pandas can be thought of as a one dimensional array that is used to handle and manipulate data which is stored in it.\n","\n","1D ndarray with an axis label"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9Nn4AV8Z0Lv8"},"source":["## Creation of Pandas Series\n","\n","A pandas series can be created using list,tuple,dictionary and numpy array.
